# My Spotify - Spotify Playlist Analysis 
My Spotify is a React App with a Node backend utilizing the Spotify API. 

Users select playlists to analyze and the program outputs the Top 10 most common songs between the selected playlists.

Motivation: built for a friend who creates playlists for clients and was curious to see which songs popped up the most frequently. 

## App Overview

### Users login using their Spoitfy credentials

What I'd like to implement:
1. Mobile friendly
2. Additional playlists analysis features, maybe a playlist generator feature
3. Improve playlist select design (possibly change to multi-select drop-down)
